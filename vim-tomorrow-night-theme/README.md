Tomorrow Theme for Vim

This repository holds the [Tomorrow Night Theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) by [@chriskempson](https://github.com/chriskempson/).

He has a separate repository called [vim-tomorrow-theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/vim-tomorrow-theme), but it's outdated, so I wanted to create my own to keep my vim config as tidy as possible.

All credits directly goes to him and other contributors.

These repository only holds the Tomorrow Night Vim Scheme, and you can install it directly with [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/Ardakilic/vim-tomorrow-night-theme.git
